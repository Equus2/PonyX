PonyX (for lack of a better name), a """"""""""""fork""""""""""" of 8chan-X.
This userscript adds various features and options like:
 * Gallery
 * Filters
 * Reverse image search
 * Flag preview
 * Mascots
 * Notifications
 * Relative post dates
 * Post and image counts in the menu
 * Many other poorly written hacks
 * Not as dead as tux's version

This is a userscript, you will need an addon to run it properly
